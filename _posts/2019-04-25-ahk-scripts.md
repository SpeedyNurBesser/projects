I have been continously working on a couple of scripts to make some things easier / faster by the means of automation using a scripting language called AutoHotkey.

It's hard to put a date on this project, as I have been making such scripts for years now and I'm still adding to them every time I see need. The first I made, when I was introduced to AutoHotkey [in a video made by German YouTuber skate702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=659RT452Smk) back in April of 2019. Some of the most useful ones I use, are available since July 7th, 2024 on GitHub:

My favorite scripts are probably the ones that use the CapsLock key on your keyboard as a modifier key, adding an entire keyboard worth of new key combinations.
