Between August 2nd and August 8th 2023, I challenged myself to write an article daily for a week. In my notes this challenge went under the name *Project Genesis*. Most of those articles weren't really good, but I wrote a concluding article which is worth sharing. I published those articles on [Medium](https://medium.com).
