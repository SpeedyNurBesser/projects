MCSettings is a web tool for the easy creation of Settings Interfaces for Datapacks in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.com) chat. It was one of my first bigger adventures into the world of Web Development. It was created during one week as an entry for a Datapack Jam. This was project was the first to combine my interests of Programming and Minecraft "modding".[^1] (Datapacks are a kind of modification of Vanilla Minecraft through an in-build system)
