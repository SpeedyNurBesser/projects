This "project" would normally count as being to trivial to be mentioned here, if the result wouldn't look this good. It creates 10,000 files to show off Kaprekar's constant in action (using [Obsidian's](https://obsidian.md) graph view)

Kaprekar's constant, if you're curious, is 6174 the number you will always get, when following kaprekar's routine on every 4-digit number which is not made up of only the same digit (like 9999). Kaprekar's routine / algorithm goes as follows:

1. Sort any 4-digit-number by the value of its digits, once low-to-high and once high-to-low: `5832` becomes `2358` (low-to-high) and `8532` (high-to-low).

2. Then substract the higher value from the lower value: `8532 - 2358 = 6174`

3. If you didn't instantaniously got `6174`, repeat with step 1 with the value you got.

After a few steps you will always end up at `6174`, unless your 4-digit-number is made up of only the same digit, which would obviously give you zero.

This graph visualiszes this quite well.
