The Fast Item Swap Datapack (a datapack is a kind of modification for Vanilla [Minecraft](https://minecraft.com) Java) was a tool that Minecraft builders could use to faster and more elequantly select their building materials making use of a key combination to switch their selected building material in no time.

From a technical standpoint this datapack was fairly simple, but probably still the most advanced data pack I made back then.

Back then, the datapack was somewhat popular having to this day (Oct 2024) been seen about 2800 times and downloaded about 160 times, but it never caught on. A couple years later a mod with similar functionality, but much better design, was introduced by popular Minecraft Youtuber [Xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/@xisumavoid) ([An Answer To Minecraft's Inventory Issues?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6DvnFCW5FY)). I'm fairly certain that I had nothing to do with the creation of said mod.

This nowadays out of date datapack is still available on a page called *PlanetMinecraft*, where I also uploaded some of my other datapacks of this era:
