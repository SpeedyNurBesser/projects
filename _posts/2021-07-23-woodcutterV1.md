The Minecraft Woodcutter Datapack (a datapack is a kind of modification for Vanilla Minecraft Java) might (I honestly don't know) be the first datapack, even the first thing, I ever uploaded.

I created some things before, but I think (?) I never made them public. I remember a really cool Magic Pack which added Volcacnos, new tree types and magic wands, but I was always one for the Quality Of Life additions.  

This datapack is fairly simple. It just adds a bunch of recipes to a workstation block in the open-world sandbox game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.com) known as the [*Stonecutter*](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stonecutter), which allows the player to cut stones into further processed forms taking less resources than would be needed otherwise. The recipes I added allowed the player to then also use the stonecutter to more cheaply process wood. (hence the name Woodcutter)

Back then, the datapack was fairly popular (for me who at that time had never released anything publicly at least) having to this day (Oct 2024) been seen about 4200 times and downloaded about 700 times.

This nowadays out of date datapack is still available on a page called *PlanetMinecraft*, where I also uploaded some of my other datapacks of this era:

A few years later, I then created an updated version of this datapack with a more sophisticated system for selecting which further processed forms of wood can be made. The datapack went under the same name.
