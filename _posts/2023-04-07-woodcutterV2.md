The Minecraft Woodcutter Datapack (a datapack is a kind of modification for Vanilla Minecraft Java) is a recreation of my first public datapack including newly added wood types.

This datapack is fairly simple. It just adds a bunch of recipes to a workstation block in the open-world sandbox game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.com) known as the [*Stonecutter*](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stonecutter), which allows the player to cut stones into further processed forms taking less resources than would be needed otherwise. The recipes I added allowed the player to then also use the stonecutter to more cheaply process wood. (hence the name Woodcutter)

The datapack was fairly popular having to this day (Oct 2024) been downloaded about 840 times on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com).

This datapack has an extension named *Sticks n' stones*, adding a few additional recipes:
