My personal homepage that looks and is controlled like a 2D topdown pixelart game (movement control and all). In the creation process of this page, the page you're on right now as well as my blog were established.

<div class='sx-button'>
  <a href='https://speedynurbesser.github.io' class='sx-button__content red'>
    Open Page
  </a>
</div>

<div class= "sx-center">
  <div class="sx-picture">
      <a href='/assets/gameifiedHomepage.png' data-lity>
          <img src="/assets/gameifiedHomepage.png">
      </a>
      <span class="sx-subtitle">A screenshot from the page.</span>
  </div>
</div>

This is one of my largest Web Dev Projects to this day (Oct 2024) and is written in vanilla javascript. The page as well as the pixelart and the bits of SFX were all made in about 10 days.

Making this was probably the most fun I ever had making a website, altough creating character animations for 8 different movement directions isn't really something I would call enjoyable.

The pixel art on this page uses the [Lost Century Color Palette made by CopheeMoth](https://lospec.com/palette-list/lost-century).
