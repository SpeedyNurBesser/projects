Bothered by the different faces of [Minecraft's](https://minecraft.com) dropper and dispenser blocks depending on their orientation, I made a resourcepack (texture / model modification) to change their models learning how Minecraft stores information about their models.

There have been similar resourepacks, but while I decided the default front face of the dropper/dispenser should be the one from the vertical orientation everyone else seemingly decided on the horizontal orientation. I am not quite sure why.
