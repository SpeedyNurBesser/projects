<p>This is one of my largest Web Dev Projects to this day (Oct 2024) and is written in vanilla javascript. The page as well as the pixelart and the bits of SFX were all made in about 10 days.</p>

<p>Making this was probably the most fun I ever had making a website, altough creating character animations for 8 different movement directions isn’t really something I would call enjoyable.</p>

<p>The pixel art on this page uses the <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/lost-century">Lost Century Color Palette made by CopheeMoth</a>.</p>

But since good writing cannot occur in such a distracting world, I in a few days created <em>A_WritingProgram</em>, a portable, distraction-free writing software for markdown, which blocks every other app on your computer until you have reached your writing goal (e.g. write 500 words or write for 1 hour).</p>

<p><em>A_WritingProgram</em> is entirely written in Python using its in-build <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tkinter</code> package. I added some quality of life features to tkinter’s default text input widget like Undo/Redo, the ability to remove entire words in one button pressing using Ctrl+Backspace / Ctrl+Delete as well as the ability to add markdown sytnax using key combinations like Ctrl+I for <em>Italic Text</em>.</p>

It creates 10,000 files to show off Kaprekar’s constant in action (using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian’s</a> graph view)</p>

<p>Kaprekar’s constant, if you’re curious, is 6174 the number you will always get, when following kaprekar’s routine on every 4-digit number which is not made up of only the same digit (like 9999). Kaprekar’s routine / algorithm goes as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sort any 4-digit-number by the value of its digits, once low-to-high and once high-to-low: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5832</code> becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2358</code> (low-to-high) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8532</code> (high-to-low).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then substract the higher value from the lower value: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8532 - 2358 = 6174</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you didn’t instantaniously got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6174</code>, repeat with step 1 with the value you got.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After a few steps you will always end up at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6174</code>, unless your 4-digit-number is made up of only the same digit, which would obviously give you zero.</p>

<p>This graph visualiszes this quite well.</p>

<p>This datapack is fairly simple. It just adds a bunch of recipes to a workstation block in the open-world sandbox game <a href="https://minecraft.com">Minecraft</a> known as the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stonecutter"><em>Stonecutter</em></a>, which allows the player to cut stones into further processed forms taking less resources than would be needed otherwise. The recipes I added allowed the player to then also use the stonecutter to more cheaply process wood. (hence the name Woodcutter)</p>

<p>The datapack was fairly popular having to this day (Oct 2024) been downloaded about 840 times on <a href="https://modrinth.com">Modrinth</a>.</p>
